# -The office- Restaurant landing page :man_cook:

Welcome to the 1st project at the GeeksHubs Academy. It consists of a little web of a restaurant in which we can see their food and get in contact with them. The office is a real restaurant in Calicanto.

The font used as the title is the same font used by the real restaurant, i thought that was important so I searched throught internet and downloaded the one that resembled more. Finally I edited the title with Photoshop and didn't need to use the font in the html, only as an image.

The names, prices and photos of the dishes are real. I got them from their Instagram. Also, the links to FaceBook and Instagram point to their real profiles.

Although it was an HTML and CSS project I've added a few javascript lines to hide/show the navbar in mobile devices.

You can check their real pages:
